# Zero Knowledge Tutorial

Hi, my name is Emir and I am a Rust Developer. I like to learn niche topics in my spare time.
And now I focus on Zero-Knowledge Proof blockchain technologies. Actually I have had the
opportunity to work in the blockchain field since 2018 but in those days there were two most
known networks in blockchain: bitcoin and ethereum. But now the blockchain field is
growing and there are many different networks and systems here.

I'm following this tutorial for this project: https://www.udemy.com/course/zero-knowledge-proofs-in-rust/

# Descriptions

The project is using Chaum-Pedersen ZKP algorithm and GRPC for communication between
client and server.
